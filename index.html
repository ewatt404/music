<h3> Niggas Can't Win So They Biting Like Tyson</h3>
<p> Hoodrich Pablo Juan's style has been mimiced by artsist from every region and few have paid homage.
  Pabo's voice and delivery are instantly recognizeable, what seperates him from the rest is the effortless wordplay.
  Pablo has also experienced a few L's over the last couple of years. Pablo's chain has been snatched
  He's allegedly been robbed and stripped naked in his own hood. Despite these setbacks Hoodrich continued to
  put out fire content, but none like his latest project the DMV. The DMV is definitely a sub to those who set Pablo
  up to get robbed litterally and figuritively. They had PJ jumped and took his whole flow. Below is ranking of <thead>
